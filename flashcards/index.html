xAs a student I want to see a single random question when I visit the page, so I can test myself
- As a student I want to access the flashcard app from the internet (GitHub pages) so I can test myself anywhere I am
- xAs a student I want to see the answer to the question so I can see if I was right
- As a student I want to get a new questions without having to reload the page so I’m not dependent on continuous internet connection
- As a student I want to add my own flashcards with a question and an answer so I can test myself with questions that I personally struggle with
- As a student I want to be able to have different categories of flashcards, so I can study different subjects.
- As a student I want to be able to delete flashcards so I can keep testing myself with relevant questions
- As a student I want my new flashcards that I made to be stored when I leave the page so I can shut down my browser (hint: you might want to use localstorage since we haven’t made apis yet, if you want to use an api checkout jsonbin)
